/*

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

/*

Solution:
dp[i][j] means the minimum distance to match s1[0...i] and s2[0...j]
1. if s1[i]=s2[j], dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1], no any action
2. otherwise, dp[i][j]=min(dp[i-1][j-1] replace, dp[i-1][j] remove s1[i], dp[i][j-1] insert s2[j] into s1[i+1])
O(nm),O(nm)
