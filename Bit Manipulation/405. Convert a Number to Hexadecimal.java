/*

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:
All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. 
If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; 
otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
