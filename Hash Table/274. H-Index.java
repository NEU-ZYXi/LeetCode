Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
    int n = citations.length, cnt = 0;
    int[] buckets = new int[n + 1];

        if (cite > n) buckets[n]++;
        else buckets[cite]++;
    }
    for (int i = n; i >= 0; --i) {
        cnt += buckets[i];
        if (cnt >= i) return i;
    }
    return 0;
